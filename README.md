# KubeDebugSess: A GitOps-Integrated Live Debugging Session Manager for Kubernetes

### ðŸ’¡ Project Overview

KubeDebugSess is a Kubernetes-native solution designed to manage, audit, and provide secure, temporary, and isolated debugging sessions for live applications. It is specifically built for environments where development and operations teams are separated and GitOps principles are strictly followed.

This tool aims to solve the dilemma where conventional debugging methods conflict with GitOps' declarative model by allowing developers to initiate a temporary, restricted debugging session on a live Pod through a familiar Git workflow, without needing direct access to the Kubernetes cluster itself.
